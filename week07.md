# HW Week 7

### Study Group Assignment:
1. [Favorite Places](https://github.com/nss-nightclass-projects/exercise-vault/blob/master/xhr_favorite_places.md).  This assignment is very close to what we did in class.  You should have 3-4 cards (setup, data creation, print cards to DOM, - bonus: sorting).  You should be able to complete this entire assignment durring studygroup.

### Individual Assignment
1. Any open projects from the first milestone.  They should already ALL be done.  But just in case you are still working on them finish them this week.
