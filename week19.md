### Individual Assignment
1. [Personal Bio Site 4](https://github.com/nss-nightclass-projects/personal-bio-site-instructions/blob/master/personal-bio-site-04.md) - This assignment is DUE July 9th.  This should be the final (for now) version of your website.  The only change you should want to make at the end of the front end course is to deploy your final capstone and add that as one of your projects (ie update your projects.json file and re-seed the database)
