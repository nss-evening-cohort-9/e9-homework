# HW Week 18

### Study Group Assignment:
1. [Doggie Day Care](https://github.com/nss-nightclass-projects/exercise-vault/blob/master/react_doggie_day_care.md) - Write some tickets and get coding.  NO COPY PASTE. Type everything out by hand.

### Individual Assignment
1. [Personal Bio Site 3](https://github.com/nss-nightclass-projects/personal-bio-site-instructions/blob/master/personal-bio-site-03.md) - This assignment is DUE June 25th.  At the end of this site you should have a deployed personal site, 3 deployed projects, and links to projects showing up from firebase.

2. [Personal Bio Site 4](https://github.com/nss-nightclass-projects/personal-bio-site-instructions/blob/master/personal-bio-site-04.md) - This assignment is DUE July 9th.  This should be the final (for now) version of your website.  The only change you should want to make at the end of the front end course is to deploy your final capstone and add that as one of your projects (ie update your projects.json file and re-seed the database)
