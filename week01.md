# HW Week 1

BEFORE SATURDAY: MAC users only - Install [X-code](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12).  Depending on your operating system this can take anywhere from 15 minutes to 8+ hours.  Please do it before class on saturday.

### Study Group Assignment:
1.  None

### Individual Assignment(s):
##### Administrative Stuff
1. Create a [github account](https://github.com).  Future employers will see this and you don't want to change it (git history is important) so think carefully about what username you choose.  For almost all students I suggest just going with some version of your first and last name.
2. Add your photo to slack and github.  Of your face - NOT your cat, dog, dinosaur, or BFF.  Your real face...semi recently.
3. Complete this form about [Studygroup Preference](https://goo.gl/forms/0HXXJ3UzxBNEyhsA3)
4. Take this [Typing Test](https://www.typing.com/student/test/3) at least 3 times and average your typing wpm together.  Reremember your average wpm for step 6 below
5. Take this [Personality Test](https://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test) and remember your personality type for step 6 below
6. Complete this form about [General Information](https://goo.gl/forms/X7uDj89IB3XmPxQk1)

##### Code Stuff
1. [Treehouse Prework](https://github.com/nss-nightclass-projects/prework) - you should be done with this already but in case you aren't get the treehouse done ASAP.  I'm talking about steps 1, 2, 4, and 5.
2. [Book Prework](https://github.com/nss-nightclass-projects/prework) - once your treehouse is completely done make sure you have done all the reading.I'm talking about steps 3 and 6.
3. [Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/) - yep you get to play a game for your HW!

Finish everything? Good work!  Take this opportunity to revisit parts of the book or treehouse that you felt uncomfortable with.  If you have done that go on to the Beyond the Basics section of the prework.  If you have done all that you deserve a nice long nap and/or a slice of pie!
