# HW Week 10

### Study Group Assignment:
1. [Shotz](https://github.com/nss-nightclass-projects/shotz) - We completed parts 1 and 2 of this in class.  Finish the last final part at your studygroup.

### Individual Assignment
1.  Update classtracker - you should have 0 assignments in your backlog - add links to all your projects.  Complete any readme's that need completing and get things in the done column.  There are a LOT of week 1-3 assignments still in progress for E9...there is no reason for that.
